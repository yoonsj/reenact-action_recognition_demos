# reenact-action_recognition_demos

This code is reproduction of tutorial for 3D CNN for action recognition in Keras presented by Anuj Shah. (http://learnandshare645.blogspot.hk/2016/06/3d-cnn-in-keras-action-recognition.html. )

KTH dataset for this code can be downloaded from http://www.nada.kth.se/cvap/actions/
make folder "kth-dataset" and sub-folders for the dataset (boxing, handclapping, handwaving, etc...) and copy the files into each folder.
